# dotfiles

## Project

The scope here is to create a singular script that can be run to set up a full terminal environment for any machine that I may be working on. Currently, it pulls the following items:
* ZSH (incl. oh-my-zsh, completions, autosuggestions and syntax highlighting)
* Dracula themes (ZSH, vim)
* Vim (incl. Pathogen, nerdtree, terminus)
* Ranger file browser, thefuck, CLI tools for cloud management, and more
* My personal dotfiles

```

## toDo

Review and update any broken dependencies
